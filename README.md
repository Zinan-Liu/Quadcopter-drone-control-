1. There are totally 8 functions, the final letter corresponds to the question letter

For example, to run 5a, in the orange circle should be “5a”, to run 5b, in the orange circle should
be “5b”. 2 circled letters are required the same all the time.

After the change, leave the “Drone.m” and run the code in “quadcopter_script.m” to see the result.

2. For each time of simulation, please allow at least 250s to observe the result as our drone is 
relative slow.

3. Note that you may required to enter “move” twice to let the drone complete the task

4. For 5e, in the “Drone.m” function, use 5a function in both places, then exit “Drone.m” and run
“quadcopter5e_script.m”

5. To increase the computation speed, we comment all the given animation command, if needed 
please uncomment them
